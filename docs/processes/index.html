This document outlines key operational processes within PLX.IE, ensuring smooth and efficient workflows across various departments. Adherence to these processes is crucial for maintaining service quality, security, and compliance.

1. Incident Management Process
1.1 Incident Detection & Reporting

Automated Monitoring: All critical systems are monitored 24/7 by automated tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) for anomalies and errors.
User Reporting: Customers and internal teams can report incidents via the support portal, email, or dedicated communication channels.
Severity Levels: Incidents are categorized by severity (P1-P4) based on impact to customers and business operations.

1.2 Incident Response & Resolution

On-Call Rotation: Dedicated on-call engineers are alerted immediately for P1/P2 incidents.
Triage & Diagnosis: The incident response team quickly triages, diagnoses the root cause, and identifies a mitigation strategy.
Communication: Regular updates are provided to affected customers and internal stakeholders via status pages and communication channels.
Resolution & Verification: Once a fix is implemented, it is thoroughly verified before the incident is closed.

1.3 Post-Incident Review (PIR)

Blameless Culture: PIRs are conducted for all P1/P2 incidents to identify contributing factors and lessons learned, focusing on systemic improvements rather than individual blame.
Action Items: Concrete action items are assigned to prevent recurrence, improve detection, and enhance response capabilities.
Documentation: PIR reports are documented and shared internally for knowledge sharing.


2. Change Management Process
2.1 Change Request (CR) Submission

All proposed changes to production systems (infrastructure, code, configuration) must be submitted as a formal Change Request.
CRs must include a detailed description, justification, rollback plan, and impact assessment.

2.2 Review & Approval

CRs are reviewed by relevant stakeholders (e.g., engineering leads, security, operations) based on their potential impact.
High-risk changes require multiple levels of approval.
Changes are scheduled during designated maintenance windows to minimize disruption.

2.3 Implementation & Verification

Changes are implemented by authorized personnel following documented procedures.
Post-implementation verification steps are executed to ensure the change was successful and did not introduce new issues.

2.4 Rollback Plan

A clear and tested rollback plan must be in place for every change, allowing for quick reversion in case of unforeseen issues.


3. Customer Onboarding Process
3.1 Initial Contact & Needs Assessment

Sales team engages with potential customers to understand their requirements and identify suitable PLX.IE services.
Solution architects may be involved for complex technical discussions.

3.2 Account Provisioning & Setup

Once a service agreement is in place, the customer success team initiates account provisioning.
Necessary resources (e.g., cloud instances, databases, API keys) are set up according to the customer&rsquo;s plan.

3.3 Onboarding & Training

Customers receive access to our comprehensive documentation and getting started guides.
Dedicated onboarding sessions and technical training may be provided for enterprise clients.
Introduction to the customer support channels and dedicated account managers.

3.4 Ongoing Support & Relationship Management

Regular check-ins by customer success managers to ensure customer satisfaction and identify opportunities for further value.
24/7 technical support available for any operational issues.
