&lt;p>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to pull back the curtain on &lt;strong>Project Nova&lt;/strong>, our groundbreaking initiative to redefine serverless computing. For too long, the promise of serverless has been hampered by the persistent challenge of &amp;ldquo;cold starts&amp;rdquo; – the delay experienced when a function is invoked for the first time or after a period of inactivity. Project Nova is engineered to virtually eliminate this bottleneck, ushering in a new era of instantaneous function execution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PLX.IE Powers Global E-commerce Leader ShopSphere Online</title><link>https://antonio-parada.github.io/plx.ie/blog/shopsphere-case-study/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://antonio-parada.github.io/plx.ie/blog/shopsphere-case-study/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-case-study-in-scalability-and-reliability-with-managed-kubernetes">A Case Study in Scalability and Reliability with Managed Kubernetes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are thrilled to announce the successful migration and ongoing partnership with &lt;strong>ShopSphere Online&lt;/strong>, a leading global e-commerce platform. ShopSphere faced significant challenges with their previous infrastructure, struggling to maintain performance and reliability during peak shopping seasons. PLX.IE&amp;rsquo;s Managed Kubernetes (K8s) solution proved to be the game-changer they needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-challenge-scaling-under-pressure">The Challenge: Scaling Under Pressure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>ShopSphere&amp;rsquo;s rapid growth led to a common problem for e-commerce businesses: their monolithic application was not designed to handle the massive, unpredictable traffic spikes associated with sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
