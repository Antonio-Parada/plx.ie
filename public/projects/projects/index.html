Project Nova: Next-Gen Serverless Engine
Status: In Development (Targeting Q4 2025 for Public Preview)
Description: Project Nova is our ambitious initiative to redefine serverless computing. We are developing a revolutionary serverless engine built on a custom-designed micro-VM architecture. This approach significantly reduces cold start times, achieving near-instantaneous function execution, and provides enhanced security through stronger isolation. Nova is designed to support a wider range of runtimes and integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD pipelines, offering unparalleled flexibility and performance for event-driven applications and microservices.">

This proactive scaling ensures optimal resource utilization, prevents performance bottlenecks during traffic spikes, and significantly reduces operational costs for our customers running containerized applications on Kubernetes. Helios is designed to be cloud-agnostic and easily extensible.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Predictive Scaling:</strong> Machine learning-driven forecasting of resource needs.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Optimizes cluster size to minimize idle resources.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Assurance:</strong> Proactively scales to maintain application responsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Community-driven development with transparent roadmap.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible:</strong> Pluggable architecture for custom metrics and scaling policies.</li>
