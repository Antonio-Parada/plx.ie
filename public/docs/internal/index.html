    <meta name="description" content="PLX.IE Internal Guidelines &amp; Best Practices
This document outlines key internal guidelines and best practices for all PLX.IE employees. Adhering to these principles ensures consistency, efficiency, and maintains the high standards of our operations.

1. Communication Protocols
1.1 Slack Usage

Channels: Use public channels for team-wide discussions and project-specific communication. Create private channels only when strictly necessary for sensitive information.
Threads: Always use threads for replies to keep conversations organized and easy to follow.
Notifications: Configure your notifications to avoid distractions while staying informed. Use @here or @channel sparingly and only for urgent, team-wide announcements.

1.2 Email Etiquette

Professionalism: Maintain a professional tone in all email communications.
Clarity &amp; Conciseness: Be clear and to the point. Use bullet points for readability.
Response Times: Aim to respond to internal emails within 24 hours and external emails within 48 hours during business days.


2. Code Development &amp; Review
2.1 Version Control (Git)

Branching Strategy: Follow the GitFlow branching model for feature development, releases, and hotfixes.
Commit Messages: Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. Use a conventional commit format (e.g., feat: Add new feature, fix: Resolve bug).
Pull Requests (PRs): All code changes must go through a pull request review process. Ensure your PRs are small, focused, and include relevant tests.

2.2 Code Quality

Linting &amp; Formatting: Adhere to project-specific linting rules and code formatting standards (e.g., Prettier, ESLint, Black).
Testing: Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all new features and bug fixes. Aim for high test coverage.
Documentation: Document complex code, APIs, and architectural decisions. Keep READMEs updated.


3. Security Best Practices
3.1 Password Management

Use strong, unique passwords for all PLX.IE accounts.
Utilize our approved password manager for storing and sharing credentials securely.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

3.2 Data Handling

Do not store sensitive customer data on local machines.
Access production systems only when necessary and with proper authorization.
Report any suspected security incidents immediately to the security team.


4. Meeting Guidelines

Agendas: All meetings should have a clear agenda distributed beforehand.
Time Management: Start and end meetings on time. Respect everyone&rsquo;s schedule.
Action Items: Clearly define action items and assign owners and deadlines at the end of each meeting.


5. Professional Development
PLX.IE encourages continuous learning. Employees are allocated a budget for conferences, online courses, and certifications. Discuss your development goals with your manager during performance reviews.">
