At PLX.IE, security is paramount. This document outlines the best practices and guidelines that all employees must adhere to to protect our systems, data, and customers.

1. Data Protection
1.1 Data Classification

All data handled by PLX.IE is classified based on its sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted).
Employees must understand and adhere to the handling requirements for each data classification.

1.2 Data Encryption

All sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using approved cryptographic standards.
Ensure proper key management practices are followed for all encryption keys.

1.3 Data Minimization

Collect and retain only the data necessary for business operations and legal compliance.
Regularly review and purge unnecessary data.


2. Access Control
2.1 Principle of Least Privilege

Employees are granted access only to the systems and data required to perform their job functions.
Access rights are reviewed periodically and revoked when no longer needed.

2.2 Strong Authentication

All internal and external systems require strong, unique passwords.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all access to sensitive systems and data.

2.3 Session Management

Implement secure session management practices, including session timeouts and secure cookie handling.


3. System &amp; Network Security
3.1 Patch Management

All systems (servers, workstations, network devices) must be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates.
Automated patching solutions are preferred where feasible.

3.2 Network Segmentation

Networks are segmented to isolate critical systems and data, limiting the blast radius of potential breaches.
Firewall rules are strictly enforced to control traffic flow between segments.

3.3 Vulnerability Management

Regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests are conducted on our applications and infrastructure.
Identified vulnerabilities are prioritized and remediated in a timely manner.


4. Employee Responsibilities

Security Awareness Training: All employees must complete mandatory security awareness training annually.
Phishing Awareness: Be vigilant against phishing attempts and report any suspicious emails immediately.
Clean Desk Policy: Ensure sensitive information is not left exposed on desks or unattended workstations.
Reporting Incidents: Report any suspected security incidents, breaches, or policy violations to the security team immediately.


5. Incident Response

Familiarize yourself with the Incident Management Process outlined in the Operational Processes documentation.
Understand your role in responding to security incidents.
