### **Project Nova: Next-Gen Serverless Engine**

**Status:** In Development (Targeting Q4 2025 for Public Preview)

**Description:** Project Nova is our ambitious initiative to redefine serverless computing. We are developing a revolutionary serverless engine built on a custom-designed micro-VM architecture. This approach significantly reduces cold start times, achieving near-instantaneous function execution, and provides enhanced security through stronger isolation. Nova is designed to support a wider range of runtimes and integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD pipelines, offering unparalleled flexibility and performance for event-driven applications and microservices.

**Key Features:**
*   **Ultra-low Cold Starts:** Sub-100ms cold start times for most runtimes.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Hardware-enforced isolation for each function execution.
*   **Broad Runtime Support:** Native support for Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and Rust.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Pay-per-execution model with granular billing.
*   **Integrated Monitoring:** Real-time metrics and logging for function performance.

### **Helios: Open-Source Kubernetes Autoscaler**

**Status:** Public Beta (Version 0.9.0 Available)

**Description:** Helios is an intelligent, open-source Kubernetes autoscaler developed by PLX.IE. Unlike traditional autoscalers that react to current load, Helios leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze historical workload patterns and predict future resource demands. This proactive scaling ensures optimal resource utilization, prevents performance bottlenecks during traffic spikes, and significantly reduces operational costs for our customers running containerized applications on Kubernetes. Helios is designed to be cloud-agnostic and easily extensible.

**Key Features:**
*   **Predictive Scaling:** Machine learning-driven forecasting of resource needs.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Optimizes cluster size to minimize idle resources.
*   **Performance Assurance:** Proactively scales to maintain application responsiveness.
*   **Open Source:** Community-driven development with transparent roadmap.
*   **Extensible:** Pluggable architecture for custom metrics and scaling policies.

### **QuantumLeap: AI-Powered Data Analytics Platform**

**Status:** Internal Alpha (Pilot Programs Underway)

**Description:** QuantumLeap is our next-generation, AI-powered data warehousing and analytics service. It automates the entire Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process using intelligent agents that can automatically detect data schemas, suggest optimal transformations, and cleanse data for accuracy. QuantumLeap provides a unified platform for data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization, enabling businesses to derive actionable insights from their data faster and with less manual effort. It integrates seamlessly with our existing data lake and big data processing services.

**Key Features:**
*   **Automated ETL:** AI-driven data ingestion and transformation.
*   **Intelligent Insights:** Automated anomaly detection and trend analysis.
*   **Interactive Dashboards:** Customizable dashboards for real-time data visualization.
*   **Scalable Data Warehouse:** Petabyte-scale data storage with high-performance querying.
*   **Integration:** Seamless connectivity with popular data sources and BI tools.
