# PLX.IE Security Best Practices

At PLX.IE, security is paramount. This document outlines the best practices and guidelines that all employees must adhere to to protect our systems, data, and customers.

## 1. Data Protection

### **1.1 Data Classification**

*   All data handled by PLX.IE is classified based on its sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted).
*   Employees must understand and adhere to the handling requirements for each data classification.

### **1.2 Data Encryption**

*   All sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using approved cryptographic standards.
*   Ensure proper key management practices are followed for all encryption keys.

### **1.3 Data Minimization**

*   Collect and retain only the data necessary for business operations and legal compliance.
*   Regularly review and purge unnecessary data.

## 2. Access Control

### **2.1 Principle of Least Privilege**

*   Employees are granted access only to the systems and data required to perform their job functions.
*   Access rights are reviewed periodically and revoked when no longer needed.

### **2.2 Strong Authentication**

*   All internal and external systems require strong, unique passwords.
*   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all access to sensitive systems and data.

### **2.3 Session Management**

*   Implement secure session management practices, including session timeouts and secure cookie handling.

## 3. System & Network Security

### **3.1 Patch Management**

*   All systems (servers, workstations, network devices) must be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates.
*   Automated patching solutions are preferred where feasible.

### **3.2 Network Segmentation**

*   Networks are segmented to isolate critical systems and data, limiting the blast radius of potential breaches.
*   Firewall rules are strictly enforced to control traffic flow between segments.

### **3.3 Vulnerability Management**

*   Regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests are conducted on our applications and infrastructure.
*   Identified vulnerabilities are prioritized and remediated in a timely manner.

## 4. Employee Responsibilities

*   **Security Awareness Training:** All employees must complete mandatory security awareness training annually.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Be vigilant against phishing attempts and report any suspicious emails immediately.
*   **Clean Desk Policy:** Ensure sensitive information is not left exposed on desks or unattended workstations.
*   **Reporting Incidents:** Report any suspected security incidents, breaches, or policy violations to the security team immediately.
