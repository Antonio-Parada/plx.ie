# PLX.IE Internal Guidelines & Best Practices

This document outlines key internal guidelines and best practices for all PLX.IE employees. Adhering to these principles ensures consistency, efficiency, and maintains the high standards of our operations.

## 1. Communication Protocols

### **1.1 Slack Usage**

*   **Channels:** Use public channels for team-wide discussions and project-specific communication. Create private channels only when strictly necessary for sensitive information.
*   **Threads:** Always use threads for replies to keep conversations organized and easy to follow.
*   **Notifications:** Configure your notifications to avoid distractions while staying informed. Use `@here` or `@channel` sparingly and only for urgent, team-wide announcements.

### **1.2 Email Etiquette**

*   **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional tone in all email communications.
*   **Clarity & Conciseness:** Be clear and to the point. Use bullet points for readability.
*   **Response Times:** Aim to respond to internal emails within 24 hours and external emails within 48 hours during business days.

## 2. Code Development & Review

### **2.1 Version Control (Git)**

*   **Branching Strategy:** Follow the GitFlow branching model for feature development, releases, and hotfixes.
*   **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. Use a conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: Add new feature`, `fix: Resolve bug`).
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** All code changes must go through a pull request review process. Ensure your PRs are small, focused, and include relevant tests.

### **2.2 Code Quality**

*   **Linting & Formatting:** Adhere to project-specific linting rules and code formatting standards (e.g., Prettier, ESLint, Black).
*   **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all new features and bug fixes. Aim for high test coverage.
*   **Documentation:** Document complex code, APIs, and architectural decisions. Keep READMEs updated.

## 3. Security Best Practices

### **3.1 Password Management**

*   Use strong, unique passwords for all PLX.IE accounts.
*   Utilize our approved password manager for storing and sharing credentials securely.
*   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

### **3.2 Data Handling**

*   Do not store sensitive customer data on local machines.
*   Access production systems only when necessary and with proper authorization.
*   Report any suspected security incidents immediately to the security team.

## 4. Meeting Guidelines

*   **Agendas:** All meetings should have a clear agenda distributed beforehand.
*   **Time Management:** Start and end meetings on time. Respect everyone's schedule.
*   **Action Items:** Clearly define action items and assign owners and deadlines at the end of each meeting.
