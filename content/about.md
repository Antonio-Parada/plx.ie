## Our Story

Founded in 2020 by a team of seasoned cloud architects and software engineers, PLX.IE was born out of a shared vision: to simplify the complexities of cloud computing and make cutting-edge technology available to everyone. We started with a focus on high-performance web hosting and quickly expanded our offerings to include a comprehensive suite of services, from managed Kubernetes to advanced AI/ML platforms.

We believe that innovation should be democratized. Our platform is built on the principles of open standards, developer-friendliness, and a commitment to continuous improvement. We are passionate about helping our customers bring their ideas to life, scale their operations, and achieve their digital ambitions.
